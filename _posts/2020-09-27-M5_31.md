# M5 - Forecasting - Part-III
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Now, I will try my hand at forecasting methods and predicting the demand for the three states and three products seperately.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

* As said earlier, this data has 42,000-time-series to forecast. I couldn't do that with my limited computing capabilities.
* So I started from the top. One time series for whole data appears to be to start the work with. But with more than a 60 million rows, the computer crashed due to low memory.
* Then, I thought of exploring all states combined in each product category. Again my ram crashed.
* So, instead of going one by one, I started thinking, what and how would a company look at the forecast.
* My hypothesis here is, there will be various levels where the necessary forecast data is looked upon
  * For example, people in HQ will look at overall states and products combines and also separately.
  * At regional HQ, concerned employees will look at the single state data, all three products forecast data, and also each store data so that they can distribute the necessary product.
  * Coming to store, the store managers will be looking at item level weekly, monthly, yearly.
  * So, with this thought process and my limited computing ability, I decided to forecast on 3 states and 3 product data. I considered each state and each product combination, collected their demand/sale on each day.
* Hence, I decide to forecast each day total demand/sale of overall items of each product category in each state i.e. forecast of Texas and food products, Texas and hobbies products etc.
* This gave me a 9-time-series forecasting prediction problem statements and luckily my computer managed to work with enough RAM to spare.
