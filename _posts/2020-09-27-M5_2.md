# M5 - Forecasting - Part-II

* After having explored this huge dataset, I wanted to explore with more of time-series components to understand the distribution much better. So, lets dive in. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

## EDA -- TIME SERIES

<p>&nbsp;</p>

### TIME SERIES

#### TOTAL PRODUCT SALES IN EACH STATE
{% include unit_sales_each_state.html %}
<p>&nbsp;</p>
A time-series visual, plotting the demand for all products in each state. WI and TX appear to be having similar demand as the year progresses to 2016 whereas, CA has been consistent with small increments over the years.
We can also see occasional spikes, highest in a year, and nill at the end of the year. This might be due to some states having SNAP days or other festival events. The nill demand is due to the closure of marts on Christmas days. 
You can toggle over the graph and select any area by drawing on the visual above and get more insights.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

#### PRODUCT SALES IN ALL STATES
{% include unit_sales_each_products_all_states.html %}
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Now let us see another time series visual. Here we are plotting the demand of products combined across all three states. As said in the previous post, we infer that the food product categories having been selling higher, then comes the household products and hobbies products respectively. We can easily infer this as people need more food products than compared to household and hobbies products. As mentioned earlier, we see occasional spikes, highest in a year especially in foods and not much in other products and nill at the end of the year. This is due to some states having SNAP days or other festival events. The nill demand is due to the closure of marts on Christmas days. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

#### UNIT SALES IN EACH STATES
{% include unit_sales_each_products_each_state.html %}
<p>&nbsp;</p>
A more in-depth visual confering all the points we have discussed in the above inferences.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

#### UNIT SALES EACH PRODUCTS MONTHLY
{% include unit_sales_each_products_each_state_monthly.html %}
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Here, I try to plot a monthly demand visual of the products across the three states separately. California and Texas food products have seen a fairly consistent increase but not a complete upward trend across the years, whereas Wisconsin has a more upward trend. This confers that we have to look into individual food product item_ids to have a clear understanding. Household and hobbies appeared to be having a similar trend across all three states. The state with a higher population will be having higher demand/sales compared to others.
