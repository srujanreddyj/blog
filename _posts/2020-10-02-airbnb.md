# An End-to-End Machine Learning Web App

Since summer, I have been learning computer vision from the basics as I wanted to apply them more in industrial automation. At the same time, many blogs and articles started screaming to create an end-to-end machine learning model to understand the engineering behind the usefulness of the machine learning model. 

So, when I came across this [applied-ml github](https://github.com/eugeneyan/applied-ml#computer-vision) by Eugene Yan, this [airbnb paper](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/amenity-detection-and-beyond-new-frontiers-of-computer-vision-at-airbnb-144a4441b72e) caught my eye and I was excited to apply to learn and learn new engineering skills by following this article.

This article was pretty in detail, an almost step by step method one can follow to create a business machine learning model. As I was learning new aspects of machine learning engineering, I wanted to follow the article step by step and replicate it and achieve similar results.  

## BUSINESS CASE:
Where can this machine learning model useful in business?
  This model can help in finding the essential amenities in a house from the photos taken by the owner and adds them to the listing automatically, thereby decreasing the errors of a chance of missing out of humans. This model could help both the lister, consumer, and Airbnb to have the right list of amenities listed on the app and also become a significant factor in determining the amount of charge a listing be listed.

## Machine learning App Process:
  1. Data Collection 
  2. Preprocessing
  3. Modelling
  4. Testing and Inference
  5. Develop API
  6. Deploy the app using API


### Data Collection 
The most important part of this problem statement is having a collection of images of house amenities. As mentioned in the article, Airbnb took majority images from internal databse and nearly 40% images from openimages dataset. 
If you go through the article, I observed that the Airbnb has images from 30 classes
