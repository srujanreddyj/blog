# An End-to-End Machine Learning Web App

After been through many blogs and article telling me to create an end-to-end machine learning model. From last summer, I have been learning computer vision as I wanted to apply them more in industrial automotion. 
Then I came across the [applied-ml github](https://github.com/eugeneyan/applied-ml#computer-vision) by Eugene Yan. I was going through the computer vision paper and then this [airbnb paper](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/amenity-detection-and-beyond-new-frontiers-of-computer-vision-at-airbnb-144a4441b72e) caught my eye.
