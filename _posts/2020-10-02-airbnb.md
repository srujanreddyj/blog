# An End-to-End Machine Learning Web App

Since summer, I have been learning computer vision from basics as I wanted to apply them more in industrial automotion. At the same time, many blogs and article started screaming to create an end-to-end machine learning model to understand the engineering behind a usefulness of machine learning model. 
So, when I came across this [applied-ml github](https://github.com/eugeneyan/applied-ml#computer-vision) by Eugene Yan this [airbnb paper](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/amenity-detection-and-beyond-new-frontiers-of-computer-vision-at-airbnb-144a4441b72e) caught my eye and I was exicted to apply learning and learn new engineering skills by following this article.
This article was pretty in detail, almost step by step method one can follow to create a business machine learning model. As I was learning new aspects of machine learning engineering, I wanted to follow the articel step by step and relicate it and achieve the similar results. 

## BUSINESS CASE:
So what is this business machine learning model about?
This model helps in finding the key amenities in a house in each one of the photos taken by the owner of the listing and adds them to the listing automatically reducing the missing out of humans. This would help both the lister, consumer and airbnb to have the right list of amenities which can be one of the important factor in determining the rates of listings.

## Machine learning App Process:
  1. Data Collection 
  2. Preprocessing
  3. Modelling
  4. Testing and Inference
  5. Develop API
  6. Deploy the app using API


### Data Collection 
The most important part of this problem statement is having a collection of images of house amenities. As mentioned in the article, Airbnb took majority images from internal databse and nearly 40% images from openimages dataset. 
If you go through the article, I observed that the Airbnb has images from 30 classes
